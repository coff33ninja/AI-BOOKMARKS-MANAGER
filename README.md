## Tech Stack (Example)

This project might utilize a combination of technologies such as:

*   **Backend:** Python (e.g., Flask, Django) for AI processing and API development.
    *   AI/ML Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn
*   **Frontend:** JavaScript (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) or a server-side templating engine (e.g., Jinja2).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

*(The specific technologies will depend on the actual implementation.)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*(Update this section with the actual prerequisites for your project.)*
*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js and npm/yarn (if a JavaScript frontend is used)
*   Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coff33ninja/ai-bookmarks-manager.git
    cd ai-bookmarks-manager
    ```
2.  **Set up the backend (Example for Python):**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up the frontend (Example for Node.js based frontend, if applicable):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend # Or your frontend directory
    npm install # Or yarn install
    ```
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file (copy from a `.env.example` if provided) and fill in necessary API keys, database URIs, or other configurations.

## Usage

1.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # From the backend directory, after activating the virtual environment
    python main.py # Or your main backend script (e.g., flask run, uvicorn main:app --reload)
    ```
2.  **Run the frontend development server (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # From the frontend directory
    npm start # Or yarn start
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` (the port will depend on your application's configuration).
